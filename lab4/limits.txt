Write here about limits and stuff for the video

Limits:
    - bitmap is stored in the superblock. since superblock is limited to 256 bytes, that means that we have limited amount of bits to represent blocks, so we are limiting
    our amount of allocatable blocks because of the size of the bitmap (256 * 8 bits, each bit represents a free/unfree block)
